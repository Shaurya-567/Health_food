      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>I used brown rice, naturally, and even threw in a handful of greens, which offer even more health bonus
            points. (The greens are optional.)</p>
          <p class="Time"> Time :10 minutes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>That way, each component will be cooked just right, and the vegetables and rice will get a chance to
            develop those delicious golden edges.</p>
          <p class="Time"> Time :15 minutes</p>
        </li>

          <p>This recipe comes together quickly. Before you get started, make sure that all of your ingredients are
            prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove. Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs
            and veggies. I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat, but if at any point you catch a whiff of
            oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.</p>
          <p class="Time"> Time :10 minutes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Warm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until a few drops of water
            evaporate within a couple of seconds. Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the
            bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly
            set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof
            spatula.</p>
          <p class="Time"> Time :20 minutes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Divide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the
            side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days (if you used purple cabbage, it
            might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat).</p>
